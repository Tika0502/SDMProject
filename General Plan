Tools to be used:

Poker Planning: https://planningpokeronline.com/ -> In fact, this website, as far as I know, is only for discuss the project process 
                                                    and suggest changes or ideas to each other and come into agreement. Basically, I do not find it that much useful, however, if the Professor asks it, we shall show it.

Discord Discussion Chat: https://discord.com/channels/1426977343783571567/1426977344220041349 -> If we are not organizing meetings in person between the three of us, then I guess shall build the project through chatting on Discord.


Project Ideas: https://www.slainstitute.com/agile-project-ideas/ -> Ammar and I, as discussed, are choosing one of the topics from this website. So please, have a look and pick one and we will decide.
