What is Planning Poker, when and how to use it?

  Poker Planning is a fun, structured way for teams to agree on the effort of User Stories, using    
  discussion + Fibonacci numbers until they converge.

  It can be used during Sprint Planning or Backlog Refinement.

  First of all, the PO clarifies the User-Story (what needs to be done and why).
  Then, the team members(Estimators) discuss the difficulties, risks, dependencies and effort needed.
  
  After discussion, Estimators assigns one of the Fibonacci numbers to the User-Story and explains the reasons why they chose it. 
  It continues until their assignment values converge, meaning get closer to each other in order to come into agreement.
