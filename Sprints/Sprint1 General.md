# Sprint 1 Backlog

Priorities:

1. User Story alignment: User Story 1.1—Signup and Login
2. Frontend: Simple, smooth user interface
3. Backend: Responsive handling of logic, data, and communication between frontend and database
4. Database: MongoDB securely stores data, eliminates redundancy, and responds reliably



   # **1. User Story alignment: User Story 1.1—Signup and Login**
   
   We chose JavaScript Framework for the User Interface Development as it contains many useful libraries and provides both quick responsive interaction between User and Backend Programs.
   Foremost, Signing Up or Logging In is the first step that either a New User or Current User needs to take, in order to access to the Website.
   Our Signup and Login interface provides User with incomplicated registration, forgotten password recovery, Full Name input and with a entertained way to upload one's Photo on the Profile.
   As keeping security a top priority in this User Story, we are also considering of implementing 2-step verufication if necessary resources as well as configurations are reachable.
   
   React.js is flexible, and every developer's go-to choice as it makes it easier to build and implement. It contains so many libraries and components which is the most advantageous part and a reason to make it
   top option when it comes to UI. 

   # **2. Frontend: Simple, smooth user interface**
   
   As discussed within our team members, keeping the simplicity of the Usage of the Website, we should build our website more compatible to our Users, even starting from the Color of the page.
   Key Components that need to be built in the website are: Menu or Navigation Bar, entering and saving Income, Expense values, Dashboard for the visualisation of the financial overview, Total Amount Calculation,      viewing the Expenses and Incomes in specific dates.

   # **3. Backend: Responsive handling of logic, data, and communication between frontend and database**
   
   The backend handles all the core logic and communication between the user interface and the database. When a user inputs income or expense data on the website, the backend processes the request, validates it,     and sends it to the database for storage. It also performs automatic calculations, such as updating total balance or monthly summaries, whenever data changes. Additionally, it ensures that the frontend            dashboard always displays up-to-date information by delivering accurate data from the server side.

   # **4. Database: MongoDB securely stores data, eliminates redundancy, and responds reliably**
   
   MongoDB securely stores all user data, such as income, expenses, and account details, in an organized and flexible way. It eliminates redundancy by using collections and documents that avoid repetitive            entries. Whenever the backend requests information, MongoDB responds quickly and reliably, ensuring smooth interaction between the data layer and the application. This helps maintain data accuracy,                performance, and stability throughout the system.
