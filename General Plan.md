# **Programming Tools**

üü¢ MongoDB

MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents instead of tables.
It is used to store and manage expense data, such as amounts, categories, and user information efficiently and at scale.

‚öôÔ∏è Express.js

Express.js is a lightweight Node.js web framework used to build the backend server and define API routes.
It handles HTTP requests, middleware, and routing, making it easy to connect the frontend with the database.

‚öõÔ∏è React.js

React.js is a JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces.
It powers the frontend of the Expense Tracker, enabling real-time updates and smooth user interactions without page reloads.

üü© Node.js

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run on the server side.
It serves as the foundation of the backend, managing API requests, executing logic, and connecting Express.js with MongoDB.


# Discord Discussion Chat: 
If we are not organizing meetings in person between the three of us, then I guess we shall build the project through chatting on Discord ([on this group](https://discord.gg/9rFtSPFs))


# Kanban Table:
To keep track on our Project by marking down the important points on ([Kanban Table](https://trello.com/b/bVJi6tZg/kanban-sdm)), it is going to be much faster and more reliable.
